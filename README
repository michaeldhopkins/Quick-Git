QuickGit, the lazy man's deployment process.

How to use:
1. Copy qgit.sh to /usr/bin/local (or the path on your system.)
2. Navigate to a folder with a git repository.
3. Type qgit.sh "commit message." The commit message must be in quotes.
4. Everything new is checked in and committed to master. Master is pushed to origin, then pushed to Heroku.

Enjoy!
